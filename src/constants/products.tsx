        The paper titled &quot;Demystifying Defects: Federated Learning and Explainable AI for Semiconductor Fault Detection&quot; introduces a novel approach to address the challenges in fault detection within the semiconductor manufacturing industry. Semiconductor manufacturing is a cornerstone of modern technology, crucial for producing devices ranging from smartphones to medical instruments. Detecting faults early in the manufacturing process is essential for ensuring product quality and reducing costs. Traditional fault detection methods often require the centralization of sensitive data, which can be problematic due to privacy concerns. The paper proposes the use of Federated Learning (FL) combined with Explainable AI (XAI) to create a decentralized model that respects data privacy while maintaining high detection accuracy. Federated Learning allows models to be trained on data distributed across multiple nodes without centralizing it, thereby preserving the confidentiality of proprietary designs and processes. Explainable AI, on the other hand, ensures that the model&apos;s decision-making process remains transparent and understandable to stakeholders.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
        In the proposed framework, each stakeholder, such as Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) or Integrated Device Manufacturers (IDMs), retains control over their data and contributes to the training of a shared model. This collaborative approach leverages the strengths of diverse datasets and machine learning models across different nodes. The combination of FL and XAI not only enhances the predictive accuracy of the model but also provides insights into how the model identifies faults, which is critical for building trust in automated fault detection systems. Empirical results from testing the proposed model on a public dataset show a significant improvement in defect detection, achieving an impressive test accuracy of 98.78%. This underscores the potential of the proposed method to revolutionize fault detection in semiconductor manufacturing, making the production process more reliable and efficient while safeguarding sensitive data.

        In a groundbreaking project aimed at revolutionizing hospital appointment systems, I engineered an AI-driven scheduling platform designed to optimize appointment allocations. Leveraging a custom Genetic Algorithm, this platform dynamically adjusts and refines scheduling to meet the complex demands of healthcare environments. By simulating the natural selection process, the algorithm intelligently prioritizes patient needs, availability, and resource constraints to minimize waiting times. This innovative solution has successfully reduced patient waiting times by an average of 35%, significantly enhancing the overall efficiency of hospital operations. The reduction in wait times not only alleviates patient frustration but also contributes to a smoother workflow for hospital staff, ultimately leading to improved satisfaction for both patients and healthcare providers. This project stands as a testament to the power of AI in streamlining processes and elevating the quality of healthcare services.{" "}

        In addition to the AI-driven scheduling platform, I developed a comprehensive web application aimed at streamlining pre-doctor visit processes and simplifying in-app appointment scheduling. This web application is designed to assist patients in conducting preliminary health analyses before their appointments, providing insights that support doctors in making initial assessments. The application integrates predictive AI algorithms to analyze patient data, offering a preliminary diagnosis that can expedite the consultation process. This project has proven to be highly effective, improving patient processing times by 20%. By reducing the time required for initial assessments, the application not only enhances the patient experience but also allows doctors to focus more on personalized patient care. The dual impact of facilitating faster processing and aiding in initial diagnoses underscores the transformative potential of AI in healthcare, making this project a critical tool for modern medical practices.
